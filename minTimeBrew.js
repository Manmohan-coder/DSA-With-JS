// LC 3494. Find the Minimum Amount of Time to Brew Potions
// You are given two integer arrays, skill and mana, of length n and m, respectively.

// In a laboratory, n wizards must brew m potions in order. Each potion has a mana capacity mana[j] and must pass through all the wizards sequentially to be brewed properly. The time taken by the ith wizard on the jth potion is timeij = skill[i] * mana[j].

// Since the brewing process is delicate, a potion must be passed to the next wizard immediately after the current wizard completes their work. This means the timing must be synchronized so that each wizard begins working on a potion exactly when it arrives. â€‹

// Return the minimum amount of time required for the potions to be brewed properly.

// Example 1:
// Input: skill = [1,5,2,4], mana = [5,1,4,2]
// Output: 110

// Example 2:
// Input: skill = [1,1,1], mana = [1,1,1]
// Output: 5

// Explanation:
// Preparation of the 0th potion begins at time t = 0, and is completed by time t = 3.
// Preparation of the 1st potion begins at time t = 1, and is completed by time t = 4.
// Preparation of the 2nd potion begins at time t = 2, and is completed by time t = 5.

// Example 3:
// Input: skill = [1,2,3,4], mana = [1,2]
// Output: 21
